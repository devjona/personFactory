# personFactory

## Goal:

- To explore the Factory Pattern with JavaScript
- To learn about using Prototypes and various `Object()` methods such as:
  - `Object.create()`
  - `Object.freeze()`
  - `Object.seal()` (perhaps)
- How closures are helpful for protecting unexpected changes to an object's properties
- To leverage BDD/TDD for sanity and expediency
  I was tinkering around with a pattern I had not used in a while and it occurred to me that I could make the most of this exercise if I added some tests to rapidly verify my assertions!

## Instructions:

1. Clone this repo
1. Install using your preferred tool (`yarn`, `npm`, etc.)
1. Run tests with `yarn test`.

## Documentation of tools used:

- [JavaScript Object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object)
- [Mocha JS](https://mochajs.org/) (for testing)
- I'd like to highlight the [Node #assert](https://nodejs.org/api/assert.html#assert) module.

## GitHub Actions:

I'm updating this README so that I have a change to merge into `main`. Let's see if a PR triggers it.
